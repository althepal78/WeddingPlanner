# WeddingPlanner
<p>
      Wedding planner is created with .NET 6 MVC 6 and is a project I am usign to learn CRUD operations. CRUD stands for create, read, update and delete.
   Thes operations are used all the time with databases.
</p>

## Google Maps API
<p>
      Additionally, with this project I learned how to use the Google Maps API and got it working with the addresss that is provided to the Add Wedding section.
  Furthermore, I was able to make a directions sections. I will eventuallly add a print me on the directions because not everyone likes using their GPS on their phone.
</p>

## Currently
<p>
      Currently I am working on updating section of the CRUD procedures. I have it working but I am trying to make the custom validation work on the client side so it 
  shows the information on the client side and makes the process quicker.

</p>

## Future Goals
<p>
      I am planning to add a method that will delete the wedding if it has already happened. So you added a wedding to the database and then it happened yesterday, I want
  it to delete automatically. I might add another database to hold the deleted ones for up to 3 years so that I can find it for future purposes. That is debatable :)
